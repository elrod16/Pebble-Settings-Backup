# Pebble-Settings-Backup
We are working to archive self-hosted Pebble watch app setting pages and make them into a redeployable format.

For anyone who wants to start helping, simply submitting downloaded pages and their resources in a ZIP compressed directory with the rebble store link and the FULL original URL of the page included in a WatchApp.txt file (this is important) in the directory root would be great. We can work on how to further package and manage the data later.
